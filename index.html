                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>In June, my investing journey began, thus starting my portfolio at £0. By the end of the month, my portfolio had a value of £616.70. With £580 deposited throughout the month, my return of £36.70 was a 6.33% ROI. In comparison, the S&P 500 saw growth of 5.11%. Thus, June saw good returns, beating my benchmark (S&P 500) by 1.22%. My portfolio consisted of £143.11 in Alphabet, £139.72 in Nike, £115.7 in Microsoft, £96.47 in JPMorgan Chase, £85 in Vanguard S&P500, £10.27 in H&M (Given for free as a sign up bonus). My only sale from this month was Nike for £157.98, depleting my stake in the company to £0. Reasoning for this was Q2 earnings report beating expectations, leaving me with a 13.1% profit from my investment - something I thought could be better invested elsewhere. Whilst  seeing huge returns was a very exciting introduction to my investment journey, I knew not to expect the same spikes in my other investments so quickly.</p>
                    <p>In July, my portfolio saw growth from £616.70 to £871.44. Taking into account £200 was invested throughout the month, my portfolio saw returns of £54.74, representing a 8.88% return in July. In comparison, the S&P 500 experienced growth of 2.2%, Dow Jones of 0.1%, and NASDAQ of 3.7%. Thus, July saw great returns, beating my benchmark by 6.6%.</p>
                    <p>In August, my portfolio saw growth from £871.44 to £901.44. Taking into account £115 was invested on the 1st August (in Alphabet), with £120.01 withdrawn at the end of the month, my portfolio saw returns of 4.016%. In comparison, the S&P 500 returned 2%, Dow Jones 3.8%, NASDAQ 0.9%. Thus, August saw good returns, staying a few % above the market. </p>

                    <h3>Alphabet</h3>
                    <p>Alphabet displayed bullish growth of 9.08% across July, making it my most profitable investment for the month. On the 21st July, I doubled my position from £143.11 to £283.86, further adding £115 on July 23rd (total £398.86). Reasoning for this was due to a multitude of factors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Q2 earnings report released on the 23rd</li>
                        <li>Alphabet's P/E ratio hovering around the 18.59 mark (the lowest of MAG 7) indicated a relatively undervalued stock (For reasons which will be explained below)</li>
                        <li>Market research indicating strong future growth</li>
                    </ul>
<h3>Earnings report</h3>
                    <p>Google has </p> ()
                    <h3>Valuation</h3>
                    <p>Google has faced a P/E ratio of around 18.59 for the since June. This measures the price of a companies share in relation to its earnings per share (i.e. how much investors are paying for $1 of company profits, in this case $18.59). Being considerably lower than other mag 7 companies like Tesla (182), Microsoft (36.5) and Amazon (41.6), this indicated that the stock was undervalued relative to its earnings potential. However, it is important to note that this percieved 'undervaluation' was not without reasons, as google has been facing a range of challenges in the eyes of investors.</p>
                    <p>Firstly, regulatory scrutiny has been a significant concern for Google. Governments worldwide have been increasingly focused on regulating big tech companies, and Google has not been exempt from this scrutiny. For example, the Antitrust division of the department of Justice alleges (originally filed in Jan. 2023) Google has abused monopoly power, stiffling competition through anti-competitive means like censoring ads for over 15 years. Possible consequences could involve the selling of Googles search engine, Chrome, from Alphabet, as well as its android OS and breaking up of google's deal with Apple to be the primary search engine through safari. Antitrust investigations and potential consequences could impact the company's profitability and growth prospects thus reasoning their 'undervalued' P/E ratio. </p>
